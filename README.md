# MapWithMultipleMarkers
This repository is for implementing a Google Map on a HTLM file with multiple Marker on it which will display information OnClick.

The implementation requires Linking of Standard Online Available Libraries of JAVASCRIPT & CSS.

Additionally you need to write your own basic Script and Style to use these Libraries.

The Repository consists of a three files.
